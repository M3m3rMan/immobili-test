## Get started

- [iOS simulator](httpss://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](httpss://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](httpss://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

When you're ready, run:

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
